This is a repository for paper "Adaptive Multi-Channel Neural Networks for Traveling Salesman Problem Optimal Tour Length Estimation Across Varying Instance Sizes".

We will soon prepare a Jupyter Notebook that is readily accessible for scholars and research colleagues interested in or related to our work. It will include the original dataset, model code, and the models described in our paper!
